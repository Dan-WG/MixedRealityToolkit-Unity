This prevents clean parts from getting contaminated again when unloaded. \r\n\r\n  Ergonomic right from loading. \r\n\r\n  The Silberhorn MWS is optimised for maximum ergonomics, so your machine operators get the most benefit. \r\n\r\n  Highlights:  \r\n\r\n Comfortable loading height of 850 mm \r\n\r\n Easy-to-move loading table with safe two-hand operation  \r\n\r\n Machine controls on a touch display at eye level";
